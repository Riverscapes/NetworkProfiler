# network-profiler


## Installation

Until this plugin is available on the plugin store you're going to need to install it manually.

1. Make sure QGis is closed.
2. Download this repo and unzip it into: `c:\Users\<USERNAME>\.qgis2\python\plugins\network-profiler\`. If you see the file: `c:\Users\<USERNAME>\.qgis2\python\plugins\network-profiler\README.md` you've done it right.
3. Reload QGis and go to the plugins menu. You should be able to check the box next to network profiler.
